             Hi! I'm a machine learning researcher currently working at <a href="https://waymo.com/research/">Waymo Research</a>.  I completed my Ph.D. at UC Berkeley advised by <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~svlevine/">Sergey Levine</a>, and my B.S. (also at Berkeley) advised by <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/">Pieter Abbeel</a>.

            
             <p>Broadly, I'm interested in understanding how to engineer machines to solve
             complex decision making problems. Examples of specific questions I'm interested in exploring include: </p>

             <ul>
                <li> How can we develop models that are robust to distribution shift, adversarial inputs, and extrapolate to novel data?
                <li> How can we engineer ML systems that are 99.999% reliable with safety guarantees?
                <li> How can we design ML that moves away from memorization and pattern recognition and performs better at long-horizon reasoning tasks?
             </ul>

             Examples of research areas I study
             include reinforcement learning, natural language processing, and robotics. For a list of my publications, please see my <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=T9To2C0AAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Google Scholar</a> profile.
